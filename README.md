# AdventureWorks Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **business intelligence dashboard built in Power BI** using the AdventureWorks dataset. It analyzes sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and geographic distribution to support data-driven decision-making.

The project was completed as a **guided, learning-by-doing exercise** as part of a Power BI course by **Maven Analytics (Udemy)**, where I recreated and understood the dashboards using provided datasets and business requirements.

---

## Learning Context
This was a **guided project**, but the focus was on:
- Understanding the business logic behind each visual
- Writing and applying DAX measures independently
- Designing dashboards for executive and operational use
- Interpreting insights rather than just replicating visuals

All dashboards were built by following the course structure while actively learning Power BI concepts through hands-on implementation.

## Business Objectives
- Track overall sales, profit, orders, and return rate
- Analyze customer value and revenue contribution
- Identify top-performing products and high-return categories
- Monitor monthly performance against targets
- Explore geographic sales distribution across regions
